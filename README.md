# Programming Paradigms - Worksheet Two

Guess what?!?  
We will be continuing with some exercises from the <https://www.scala-exercises.org> site.

1. Got to the site.
2. Login with your nice new shiny `GitHub` account.
3. Follow the [`Scala Tutorial`][tut] path (click on the `Start` button) - just in case you had forgotten.

For this week you should complete the following exercises:

+ `Tail Recursion`,
+ `Structuring Information`,
+ `Higher Order Functions`, and
+ `Standard Library`.
